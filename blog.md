Title: Remember to take into consideration Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference when working with JSON data and using .map(), .filter(), and .forEach()., and other iterative methods or functions.

For my final project for phase 1 of the Flatiron Software Engineering Bootcamp, I created a single page website that displays the breweries of New York City. I used a pubic API from Open Brewery DB (INSERT LINK) but needed to filter the massive dataset down to just breweries located within the city. To do this, first I was able to get CSV file with all of the zip codes of NYC. I created a dictionary object with this file and breweries that matched with the zip code were pushed into a new array and eventually saved into its own db.json file. While I was able to do this successfully, I noticed some wonky behavior concerning some the arrays and objects I created and the various iterative methods I called on them. After deep diving into the problem and debugging the issue, I figured out the cause of this buggy behavior; I was not taking into consideration pass by reference and value.

Before I begin, I want to provide a quick review of the iterative methods I used frequently to complete my labs, homeworkâ€™s, and final project: .map(), .filter(), and .forEach().


## `array.map()`

How `.map()` works: it takes the elements within the array it was called on, does something to each one with a function you provide, and returns the processed elements in a new array. The original array stays the same 

`
myArray = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const result = myArray.map(element => {
    return element * 2
})

console.log("The new array is: ")
console.log(result)

console.log("The original array is: ")
console.log(myArray)

// The new array is: 
// [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
// The original array is: 
// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
`


## `array.filter()`

How `.filter()` works: it takes the elements within the array it was called on, and runs each element through some condotional statement or function, and if it returns true, places the original element into a new array.

`
myArray = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

const result = myArray.filter(element => {
    element = element * 2
    return element > 3
})

console.log("The new array is: ")
console.log(result)

// The new array is: 
// [2, 3, 4, 5]
`

Notice that even though each element was doubled, the original value of the element was pass into the array.


## `array.forEach()`

How `.forEach()` works: it takes the elements within the array, and does something to each one with a function you provide. It sounds similar to `.map()` except `.forEach()` doesn't return the element or processed element (unless you declare a variable, array, etc outside of the function and assign or push the element into this variable)

`
forEach example
`

What does this have to do with pass by value vs pass by reference:

`myArray` was an array of integers, and integers are primative values. When you pass a primative value into a function, a copy of that value gets passed in. You can change the variable within the function but it doesn't change the variable outside of the function

` function double (x) {
    x = x * 2
    return x;
}

let y = 100; 
let result = double(y)

console.log(y) // 100
console.log(result) // 200
`

When working with JSON data, you have an array of OBJECTS, an important distinction here. Objects are passed by reference in JavaScript. What this means is JavaScript passes the direct location / address in memory where the object is located into the function, not a copy of it. If you change the property within the function, it persists outside of the function.

` function doubleProperty(obj){
    obj.value = obj.value * 2
    return obj // 
}

const myObj = {value : 10}

console.log("Original object: ")
console.log(myObj)

const result = doubleProperty(myObj)

console.log("New resulting object: ")
console.log(result)

console.log("Original object: ")
console.log(myObj)

// Original object: 
// { value: 10 }
// New resulting object: 
// { value: 20 }
// Original object: 
// { value: 20 }
`

And even if you remove the `return` statement, the results are still the same: the original object will get modified. This needs to be taken into account when calling on iterative methods such as map, filter, and forEach on JSON data! 

Here is an example. Say you have json data of the following structure:

`{studentName, favoriteColor, favoriteNumber}`

If you want to double each student's favorite number and store it in a new json array, you would write the following lines of code:

` 
const studentsArray = [{
    "studentName" : "Chris",
    "favoriteColor" : "blue",
    "favoriteNumber" : "15" 
    },
    {
    "studentName" : "Rose",
    "favoriteColor" : "blue",
    "favoriteNumber" : "36" 
    }]


const results = studentsArray.map(studentObj => {
    const newObj = studentObj
    newObj.favoriteNumber = newObj.favoriteNumber * 2
    return newObj
})

console.log("original: ")
console.log(studentsArray)

console.log("updated: ")
console.log(results)
`

The results are:

`
original: 
[
  { studentName: 'Chris', favoriteColor: 'blue', favoriteNumber: '30' },
  { studentName: 'Rose', favoriteColor: 'blue', favoriteNumber: '72' }
]
updated: 
[
  { studentName: 'Chris', favoriteColor: 'blue', favoriteNumber: 30 },
  { studentName: 'Rose', favoriteColor: 'blue', favoriteNumber: 72 }
]:

`

Even if you do not intend on using the original array, for better coding practicie one should take this issue into consideration. Fortunately, there is a way to solve this issue: using the spread operator (...). 


const results = studentsArray.map(studentObj => {
    const newObj = {...studentObj}
    newObj.favoriteNumber = newObj.favoriteNumber * 2
    return newObj
})

`original: 
[
  { studentName: 'Chris', favoriteColor: 'blue', favoriteNumber: '15' },
  { studentName: 'Rose', favoriteColor: 'blue', favoriteNumber: '36' }
]

updated: 
[
  { studentName: 'Chris', favoriteColor: 'blue', favoriteNumber: 30 },
  { studentName: 'Rose', favoriteColor: 'blue', favoriteNumber: 72 }
]
`

One function of the spread operator COPIES the contents of an array or object and spreads it into a corresponding new array or new object. If you then make a change to the new array or object, the original stays intact.
